They may not all be human, but they all share a voice. For UCSC's MS G+PM '15.

Star Crossing is a game currently being developed by three master's students at UC Santa Cruz. At its core, Star Crossing is a rhythm game, similar in gameplay to osu! or Final Fantasy Theatrhythm, but there's much more to Star Crossing than pressing buttons at the right time, because the essence of Star Crossing is its story: the tale of an a cappella group, a closely knit pack of friends, making a name for themselves through music. Between each rhythm gameplay segment, players will then deal with the interactions of the characters, and cultivating the characters' friendships and moods is key to optimizing gameplay and maximizing score. 

The core loop of Star Crossing goes something like this:
1. Select a song, which characters will solo on the song, and which character(s) to play as.
2. Play the song.
3. Receive feedback and/or a score.
4. Character statistics change based on results.
5. Repeat.
