Randall "Star Crossing, assemblllllllllllle!"
Julie "Here!"
Carol "Present."
Tani "Randall, no, you aren't using that as our call."
Randall "What's wrong with it? Nikolai would agree with me, right?"
Randall "...Tani, where's your brother? Is he still unpacking?"
Tani "What? He was right--"
Tani "Nikolai, get over here and stop sulking."
Nikolai "I'm not sulking."
Randall "Okay, Nick, thoughts: 'Star Crossing, assemblllllllle!'...?"
Nikolai "Don't call me Nick."
Randall "...Gotcha."
Randall "Okay, so! Game plan, guys! We're here. First week of live shows, the genre prompt is pop..."
Julie "We're gonna be on TV!"
Carol "The statistical likelihood of us making it past the preliminaries was very low! We should all be proud!"
Julie "Um...Yeah!"
Nikolai "Yeah, super excited."
Tani "Bro, come on. The bot's right."
Julie "Ahem."
Tani "...Sorry, Carol is right. Getting this far as a self-taught a cappella group on a show full of bands? I'm kinda surprised too."
Julie "It's true guys, we've done really well."
Carol "We don't have sponsors, or voice coaches, and most human music has instruments, which we lack!"
Julie "Carol!"
Randall "Oh, come on. You've got me, right?"
Tani "You're a music major with a vocal emphasis. You're not a vocal coach."
Randall "I've filled the part as best I could, okay? And we don't need fancy instruments or sponsors, or...whatever!"
Randall "We are five of the best singers this world has ever seen. The world just doesn't know it yet. We made Tani's mom cry that one time!"
Tani "You do have a point there."
Randall "Exactly! We are going to rock this competition and show the world what Star Crossing is all about!"
Julie "Whooo!"
Carol "Yes!"
Nikolai "But if we lose, we can go home, so that's good too!"
Randall "Hey. None of that."
Randall "It's business time now. We need to decide on a song for this week."
Julie "Yeah. Pop's such a broad topic..."
Carol "Would it be beneficial to make a list of songs we know collectively and then vote on a favorite?"
Randall "What if we think of songs that feel...themed, like to announce that we're here and ready to go?"
Randall "Like a  'Let's do this!' kind of feel to it, know what I mean?"
Julie "Ooh ooh ooh, I got one!"
Julie "'You Should Be Dancin',' by Chipper Dales."
Nikolai "What? That's the cheesiest song I've ever--"
Tani "I like it."
Randall "Good one, Julie! That totally fits."
Randall "Is Rusty booted up?"
Rusty "I am on! Your command?"
Randall "Get us a good pop beat."
Rusty "Which drum kit bank would you like?"
Randall "The beatboxing one. I tell you that every time."
Rusty "Roger! I will play when ready."
Julie "A'ight, let's do this!"
