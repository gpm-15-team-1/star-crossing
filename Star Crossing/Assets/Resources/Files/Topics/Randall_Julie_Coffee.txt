Randall "Pssh. I'm buying you a cappuccino and there's nothing you can do about it."
Julie "A cappuccino? I've never tried one before..."
Randall "You...haven't? I thought they were your favorite!"

Julie "I don't know how YOU like it so much!"
Randall "Jeez, I can like something, can't I?"
Julie "You can. I just...respectfully won't be joining you."
