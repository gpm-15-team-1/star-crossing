"Hi."
"Oh. Hi."

"Ow! Watch it!"
"Ah, sorry! Wasn't looking where I was going."

"Gah! Sorry, did I bump into you?"
"Watch it! Jeez!"

"Oh, hey. Got a minute?"
"Oh, uh, I was going to go tune up Rusty. Sorry!"

"What's with the outfit? I feel like I always see you wearing that."
"Hey, back off! I like my clothes, and that's all that matters."

"Sooo, I was thinking..."
"Look, really, I'm not in the mood to chat right now. Sorry."

"You feeling okay? You look down."
"I'm fine. Leave me alone."
