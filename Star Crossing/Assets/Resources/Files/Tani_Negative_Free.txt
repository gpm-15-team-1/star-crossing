"Hello."
"Oh...hello."

"Ah! Careful!"
"Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to bump you."

"Ah, pardon me. Didn't see you there."
"Just keep an eye out in the future, okay?"

"Hey, are you free for a minute?"
"Oh, uh, no. I have somewhere to be. Sorry."

"I feel like I never see you get adventurous with your wardrobe."
"Begging your pardon, but I'm quite happy with my clothing, and that's that."

"Um...nice weather we're having."
"I'm sorry. I'm not in the mood to chit-chat."

"Is everything okay? Are you upset?"
"I'd like a moment to myself, thank you."
