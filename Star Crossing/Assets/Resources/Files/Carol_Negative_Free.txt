"Hello."
"Hello."

"Ah! I am sorry!"
"I am sorry! I did not mean to bump you!"

"Ah, I am sorry! I did not mean to bump you!"
"I am fine. It's my fault too."

"Excuse me, do you have a moment to talk?"
"Yes? I mean, uh...I was planning to run a diagnostic on myself, actually. I should do that regularly."

"You have a, um...unique fashion sense. What can you tell me about it?"
"I...am I dressing wrong? I thought I did a good job of imitating human fashion sense!"

"Excuse me...about the last time we spoke..."
"I...I am sorry. I think my energy is running low. I do not feel fit for conversation."

"Um...are you not feeling well?"
"I...I think I will excuse myself for a moment."
