"Hey."
"Hey."

"Oy! Watch it."
"Ah, geez...didn't mean to bump you."

"Ack, sorry! Didn't mean to run into you."
"It's...fine. Just be careful."

"Hey, you got a minute?"
"Oh, uh. I was going to, um, tweak our arrangement. Maybe later."

"So, uh, where'd you put that ensemble together? I'm curious."
"Oy, my clothing choices are my own business."

"Hey, so, about what I was saying earlier..."
"Can we...not talk right now? I'm not in the mood."

"Hey, why the long face?"
"Can you just stop, please?"
