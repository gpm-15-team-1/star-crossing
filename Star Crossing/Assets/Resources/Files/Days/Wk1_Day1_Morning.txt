Julie "Whew! Here we are, room 308!"
Carol "Ah! I find this hotel room aesthetically pleasing!"
Carol "That must mean that 'HomeDec' patch I downloaded last week really works! What an odd sensation!"
Julie "Carol, I'm less interested in these patches you keep installing on yourself than I am in making sure your voice banks are up to speed."
Julie "I'm nervous enough about this competition as it is; I can only imagine how strange it would feel to an android."
Julie "Asked to be an artist on stage, I mean. And not just that, but to be the 'best' of them."
Carol "Do you think I am not equipped to help our group win, Julie?"
Julie "No, no! I just want to make sure you're feeling fine. You can come to me about anything, okay? I'm here for you."
Carol "Thank you, Julie...that means a lot to me. You are a true friend."
