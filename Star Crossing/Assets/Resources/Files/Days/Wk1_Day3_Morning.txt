Tani "Hey, you're up."
Nikolai "Is that so surprising?"
Tani "From my brother, yes."
Nikolai "Jet lag's starting to wear off, I guess. Which is...great. I guess."
Tani "..."
Nikolai "Fine. I figured I should give a...modicum of effort today, for once. I feel like Randall was giving me the stink-eye yesterday."
Tani "Go easy on him. This means a lot to him, y'know? And I think we're all capable of making it a reality for him."
Tani "And that includes you. I know what you're capable of, li'l brother."
Nikolai "You think I care what Randall wants? He's your friend, not mine. I couldn't care less about fulfilling HIS dream."
Tani "Oh, come on. Have a little heart."
Nikolai "..."
Tani "Sorry, I didn't mean..."
Nikolai "No, you're right. It's dumb. Just a phrase."
Tani "Still. I should have tried to be more sensitive. I know how much that affected you."
Nikolai "No. You don't know."
Tani "..."
