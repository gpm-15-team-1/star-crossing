Randall "That. Was. AWESOME!"
Julie "Eeeeeeee!! We did it! We did it we did it we did it!"
Julie "We're on TV we're on TV people loved us on TV!"
Tani "Easy, Jules. You'll make your head explode if you keep jumping up and down like that."
Julie "...yes, Mom."
Julie "But omigawd we did it!"
Carol "Indeed we did! My new upgrades performed better than expected!"
Carol "But I had to reorganize my processes a bit to open up memory, and I may have gotten carried away..."
Tani "Really, guys, that was great. Iâ€™m really..."
Tani "*cough*"
Tani "...proud of us."
Randall "...Tani, are you okay?"
Tani "Yeah, I'm fine."
Tani "*ahem* It's just been a while since I did so much singing in a single week. I just need some water."
Randall "Are you sure? You're our best singer--"
Carol "Wait. Does anyone know the square root of 24,649?"
Julie "...Is that something you can forget?"
Carol "I don't save things like that! I must have misplaced the pointer to my calculator function!"
Nikolai "It's 157. I just checked."
Julie "...dang, I didn't know you could type that fast on a phone."
Julie "Must be your arm's improved reflexes!"
Nikolai "I...what? That's not..."
Julie "You're suuure you don't want to let me take a look? If that's really a Cellagram B-2000, I'd like to--"
Nikolai "Keep your hands off me!"
Randall "Nik? Oy, man, come back!"
Tani "Ah, just give him a bit to himself."
Julie "Sorry..."
Tani "It's fine. He just gets...touchy about his augments. Asking about them isn't...*cough* the best idea, curious though you might be."
Julie "Right, yeah. My bad."
Randall "Aw, come on, guys. This is no time to mope, it's a time to celebrate!"
Randall "One week down, six to go!"
Randall "If we make it to the finals. Which we will! I have every ounce of confidence in you guys."
Randall "Now who's up for a toast down at that joint on Second Avenue? I think we've earned the right to party a little."
Julie "Ooh, count me in!"
Carol "Um, Julie, may I ask you to check me first? I still can't find my calculator pointer."
Julie "Ha, fair enough. Let's get cleaned up and take a look at that."
Julie "Meet you guys in the lobby in half an hour?"
Tani "Excellent. I'll pass it on to Nikolai."
Randall "Then that's a wrap! Good work, team!"
