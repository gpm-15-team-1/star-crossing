Randall "Mind if I sit with you?"
Julie "Oh, no, go ahead! I didn't think you would come down with here with us."
Randall "Oho, I may have had <color=yellow>four espressos</color> already, but there's always room for one more!"
Julie "Um...how long have you been awake, exactly?"
Randall "Couldn't sleep last night. Gave up at about three in the morning and edited our sheet music. Reprinted it in that conference room on the second floor."
Randall "See? I changed the dynamics in a lot of places. There's a crescendo now at that bit in the chorus, right? And I changed that one mezzo piano to a mezzo forte, and I wrote in the key change properly this time!"
Julie "All I'm seeing right now is that your hands are shaking."
Randall "Yeah, um. An unintended side effect, I assure you."
Julie "It's not assuring. Gimme that."
Randall "Nooooo! Not my Espresso Number Five!"
Randall "(A little bit of cafe au lait in my life, a little bit of cappuccino by my side~)"
Randall "What's that you have there, anyway?"
Julie "Oh, I ordered a <color=yellow>mocha</color>. Call me a wuss, but I love chocolate."
Randall "Heh, I'll have to keep that in mind. Who knows if I'll ever take you out to a cafe and have to remember to order you a mocha."
Julie "Oh, stop."

Tani "May I sit with you?"
Carol "Of course you may, Tani!"
Tani "Thank you. What did you order?"
Carol "Since this is my first time consuming coffee, I decided that it would be safest to start basic. This is <color=yellow>plain coffee with half-and-half.</color>"
Tani "Do you like it?"
Carol "I do not know. It is interesting. I am unaffected by caffeine, but I wished to learn the taste."
Tani "I suppose, if nothing else, this really is a learning experience for you."
Carol "What did you order, Tani?"
Tani "Ah, this is a <color=yellow>cappuccino</color>. The texture of espresso drinks is a little different from plain coffee. I like it."
Carol "I am glad that you enjoy it."
Tani "Heh, thanks."

Randall "Yo, Nikolai. Mind if I sit here?"
Nikolai "Yes, but you don't care, do you--"
Randall "Thanks, man! I knew you were a cool dude."
Nikolai "Do you have nothing better to do than harass me?"
Randall "Naw, you just looked lonely over here, and I figured I'd give you some company. What've you got there?"
Nikolai "Coffee."
Randall "Yeah, I know, I mean what kind of coffee?"
Nikolai "<color=yellow>Coffee. As in, black coffee. Coffee coffee.</color>"
Randall "Ah, straight and to the point! I like it. <color=yellow>Like my espressos!</color>"
Nikolai "I'm not sure I should trust a person who gets so excited about espressos."
