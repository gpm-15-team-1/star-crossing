Julie "Phew. Unpacking is harder work than I thought."
Rusty "Hello, Carol! Reporting for duty!"
Julie "Oh, you booted up Rusty! Thank you!"
Carol "You're welcome. I imagined he should be ready for rehearsal."
Julie "Good point. Randall said he wanted to meet in the lobby pretty soon after we got here. We should head out."
Julie "Come, Rusty!"
Rusty "Roger!"
Carol "Randall seemed eager to get started today."
Julie "Tell me about it. Wouldn't shut up about picking just the right song..."
Randall "Aha, there's our other half of Star Crossing!"
Julie "Hey, Rands! We made it!"
Randall "Glad we're all in one piece. I've got our music ready. I took the liberty of arranging 'You Should Be Dancin'' by Chipper Dales for six parts last night."
Nikolai "Which I have not failed to inform him is the cheesiest tune he could possibly have picked."
Tani "Hush, brother. I think it's a fine song."
Julie "You...wrote all this in one night? Color me impressed!"
Randall "Oh, stop, it was nothing. All in a day's work to help Star Crossing succeed!"
Randall "Now let's get us warmed up. I've got my pitch pipe right here."

Randall "Music: check. Pitch pipe: check. Pencil: check."
Tani "Didn't know you were the type to talk to yourself. But maybe I should've suspected it."
Randall "Ah, and the great Tanya Kozlova reads me like a book once again! When will she realize her prodigal talent as a psychic?"
Tani "Oh, stop. Is the great Randall Creed ready to accompany the poor, lonely Tanya Kozlova downstairs?"
Randall "On my way. Can't let the others beat us there, now can we? A leader's gotta be punctual."
Tani "Well, you are good at setting a shining example at such things."
Randall "Ha! Tani, you flatter me."
Tani "Who else'll fluff your ego?"
Randall "Ouch! A cruel mistress, she is!"
Nikolai "I'd rather you call my sister neither 'cruel' NOR a 'mistress,' Randall."
Randall "Ah, there he is! Forgive me, Nikolai. Merely a turn of phrase."
Randall "Actually, no, don't forgive me. I stand by the opinion that that was funny."
Tani "You think everything you say is funny, Rands."
Randall "I try, at least."
Randall "Aha, there's our other half of Star Crossing!"
Julie "Hey, Rands! We made it!"
Randall "Glad we're all in one piece. I've got our music ready. I took the liberty of arranging 'You Should Be Dancin'' by Chipper Dales for six parts last night."

Tani "Hello? Is my brother in there?"
Nikolai "Of course I'm in here, you saw me walk in the door half an hour ago."
Tani "Oh, who knows. You might have gone down to the lobby early."
Nikolai "Oh, you're real funny, Tani."
Tani "Lighten up a little. I think this'll be fun. Wouldn't it feel good to be up on stage again?"
Nikolai "I'm not in the mood."
Tani "Maybe not now. But I have a feeling that'll change in due time, Nikolai."
Nikolai "..."
Tani "Hey, Rands."
Randall "Ah, the unbreakable sibling duo approacheth!"
Nikolai "...morning, Randall."
Tani "You look ready to go. Are we waiting on the others, then?"
Randall "Yup. Julie's not always the most prompt person, but she seemed excited for this..."
Randall "Aha, there's our other half of Star Crossing!"
Julie "Hey, Rands! We made it!"
Randall "Glad we're all in one piece. I've got our music ready. I took the liberty of arranging 'You Should Be Dancin'' by Chipper Dales for six parts last night."
