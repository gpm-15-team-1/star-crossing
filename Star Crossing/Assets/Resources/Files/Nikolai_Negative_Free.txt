"Hey."
"...Hey."

"Hey! Watch the arm!"
"Gah...sorry. Wasn't looking."

"Ack, sorry...I didn't see you."
"Dude, personal space, please!"

"Hey. You got a minute?"
"Um, I was going to go...do a thing."

"Why do you always wear that, anyway?"
"Okay, no. You are NOT dissing the scarf."

"Hey, so...about earlier..."
"Look, can we not? I'm really not in the mood to talk right now."

"What's with that look?"
"Don't you have somewhere to be?"
