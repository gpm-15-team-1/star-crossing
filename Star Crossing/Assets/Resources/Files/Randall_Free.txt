"I'm thinking about ordering pizza. Have a request?"
"Not sure why, but nothing beats plain cheese for me. Deep dish is the best!"

"Stop me if I've asked you this before, but...cats or dogs?"
"Ooh, dogs. Not the little ones, but medium or big ones. They always seem so happy!"

"Mm, nice day, isn't it?" 
"Yeah. It sure seems to get sunny here a lot."

"I didn't see you around yesterday evening. Were you doing something?"
"Oh! Yeah, I was working on an original in my room. The verse is a work in progress,@but I've got the hook and some lyrics down pat."
