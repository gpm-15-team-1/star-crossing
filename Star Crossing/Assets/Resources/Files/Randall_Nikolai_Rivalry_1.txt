Randall "Listen, Nikolai, real talk. Can we take some time off the record to get your act straight?"
Nikolai "Randall, the last time you tried to help me, it didn't work out too well for either of us."
Randall "I'm talking about your attitude. I know you're not too optimistic about our chances, but groaning at everything all day long is seriously depressing to the rest of the team."
Nikolai "You want me to not say anything? That's the only thing I can say that isn't depressing."
Randall "You know what? Sure, that'll do. Just don't say anything when we're at practice."
Nikolai "I'll keep all my comments on the inside where I keep the rest of what I think of you."
Randall "Whatever, buddy."
Nikolai "Don't call me 'buddy,' Randall. Competition is obviously more important to you than your buddies."
